=========

**NOTE**: pre-alpha software, mostly untested and still in development. Early feedback is welcome, but use at your own risk.

Futures-based client- and server-side abstractions for HTTP file uploads (POST requests with  `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`).

Preliminary support for Hyper 0.11 is available via the `hyper` feature.
